# Excel_PivotTable
üìå One of the assignment about learning data analyst in Studi Independen bootcamp by Karier.mu

üìå I was given a [dataset](./Data/dataset.csv) in Excel where I have to clean the data and also answer several given questions.

## Cleaning Data Steps :
1. Check for duplicates: Click Data ‚Üí Data Cleanup ‚Üí Remove Duplicates.
2. Remove the 'RM' prefix in the "Price" column so the values can be visualized properly.
3. Fill missing values in the "Price" column using the average (=AVERAGE).
4. Fill missing values in the "Bathroom" column using the mode (=MODE).
5. Fill missing values in the "Car Park" column using the mode (=MODE).
6. Remove the value "studio" from the "Rooms" column.
7. Replace values like "3+1" with 4, "3+2" with 5, etc., using Find and Replace in the "Rooms" column.
8. Remove entries like "3+", "20 above", and similar from the "Rooms" column.
9. Fill missing values in the "Rooms" column using the median (=MEDIAN).
10. Remove rows with missing values in the "Furnishing" column.
11. Remove invalid entries like "land area = -sq", "kuala lumpur -sq", and "0 sq" in the "Size" column.
12. Remove rows with missing values in the "Size" column.
13. Remove the word "built-up" in the "Size" column since the variable refers to the total property area.
14. Remove text like "land area:" and "sq ft" to make the "Size" column suitable for visualization (e.g., boxplot).
15. Replace values like "40x80" with their actual calculated area (e.g., 40√ó80 = 3200) in the "Size" column.

## Questions & Answers :
1. Categorize the property prices where 'Low' is below 1,163,876, 'Mid' is below 3,817,500, and anything above is 'High'.

   üîç Add Column 'Category', then write formula | =IF(B2<1163876, "Low", IF(B2<3817500, "Mid"  , "High")) | for its value (note : B2 = 'Price' column)
2. What are the top three locations that have the highest number of properties, and the bottom three locations that have the lowest number of properties?

   üîç Create a [Pivot Table](./Question_2/no2.csv) from [clean_data.csv](./Data/clean_data.csv)
   
   üîç Rows = 'Location'

   üîç Values = 'Location'

   üîç Summarize the 'Location' values by COUNTA

   üîç Sort the results by the count in descending/ascending order

   üîç Use a chart to better illustrate the data.

3. Which furnishing status dominates in all locations?

   üîç Create a [Pivot Table](./Question_3/no3.csv)

   üîç Rows = 'Furnishing'

   üîç Values = 'Furnishing'

   üîç Summarize the 'Furnishing' values by COUNTA

   üîç Sort the results by the count in descending order

   üîç The answer is 'Partly Furnished'

4. What is the average land size in each location category?

   üîç Create a [Pivot Table](./Question_4/no4.csv)

   üîç Rows = '1.Category'

   üîç Values = 'Size'

   üîç Summarize the 'Size' values by AVERAGE

5. Which 3 locations have the highest average property prices?

   üîç Create a [Pivot Table](./Question_5/no5.csv) from [clean_data.csv](./Data/clean_data.csv)
   
   üîç Rows = 'Location'

   üîç Values = 'Price'

   üîç Summarize the 'Prices' values by AVERAGE

   üîç Sort the results by the count in descending order

   üîç Use a chart to better illustrate the data.
